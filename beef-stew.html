    <h1>Beef Stew:</h1>

    <img src="./img/bs.jpg" alt="Chunks of beautiful beef

     <p><strong>Beef stew</strong> is a hearty, comforting dish made with 
        tender chunks of beef, slow-simmered with carrots,
         potatoes, and other vegetables in a rich, flavorful 
         broth. The stew develops deep flavors from herbs, 
         garlic, and red wine, creating a warm and 
         filling meal perfect for cold days. It's thickened 
         as it cooks, resulting in a savory, satisfying one-pot
          dish often served with crusty bread or over mashed potatoes.
