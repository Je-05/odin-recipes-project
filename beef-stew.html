    <img src="./img/bs.jpg" alt="Chunks of beautiful beef

    <p> <strong>Beef stew</strong> is a hearty, comforting dish made with 
        tender chunks of beef, slow-simmered with carrots,
         potatoes, and other vegetables in a rich, flavorful 
         broth. The stew develops deep flavors from herbs, 
         garlic, and red wine, creating a warm and 
         filling meal perfect for cold days. It's thickened 
         as it cooks, resulting in a savory, satisfying one-pot
          dish often served with crusty bread or over mashed potatoes.

        <li>2 Celery Stalks, <strong>Chopped</strong></li>
        <li>3 Cups Beef Broth</li>
        <li>1 Cup Red Wine, <strong>(Optional</strong>, <em>or Use More Beef Broth)</em></li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons Tomato Paste</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>2 Bay Leaves</li>
        <li>1 Teaspoon Dired Thyme</li>
        <li>1 Teaspoon Dired Rosemary</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Cooking Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong> In a Bowl</strong>, toss the beef cubes with salt, pepper, 
        and 2 tablespoons of flour until the beef is evenly coated.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Heat</strong> 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large Dutch oven or
            heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat. Brown the beef
            in batches, making sure not to overcrowd the pot. 
            Cook for about 3-4 minutes per side until the beef is
            golden brown. Transfer the browned beef to a plate and set aside.
        </li>
        <li><strong>In the Same Pot</strong>, add another tablespoon of olive oil. 
            Saut√© the chopped onions and celery for about 5 minutes,
             until softened. Add the minced garlic and cook for 1 minute
              until fragrant.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Stir</strong> in the tomato paste and cook for 2 minutes to caramelize.
             Then, pour in the red wine (if using) to deglaze the pot, 
             scraping up any browned bits stuck to the bottom. Let the wine
              simmer for 2-3 minutes to reduce slightly.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Add</strong> the beef broth and Worcestershire sauce, stirring
             everything together.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Return</strong> the seared beef (along with any juices) to the pot. 
            Add the chopped carrots and potatoes, bay leaves, thyme, 
            and rosemary.
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>Bring</strong> the stew to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low. 
            Cover and let it cook gently for 1.5 to 2 hours, until the beef
             is tender and the flavors have melded.
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>If</strong> the stew needs thickening, mix 1 tablespoon of flour with a
         bit of cold water to form a slurry, then stir it into the stew. 
         Let it simmer for another 10 minutes to thicken.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>In the last 10 minutes of cooking</strong>, stir in the frozen peas 
            (if using). Remove the bay leaves and adjust the seasoning with
             salt and pepper as needed.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Ladle</strong> the beef stew into bowls and garnish with fresh parsley
             if desired. Serve with crusty bread or over mashed potatoes.
        </li>
    </ol>
