            <li>Fresh parsley for garnish</li>
            <li>Egg Noodles or Rice for serving</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Cooking Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Thinly slice the beef into strips, about ¼-inch thick.
                 Season with salt and pepper.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet over 
                medium-high heat. Add the beef in batches to avoid 
                overcrowding the pan, and cook for about 2 minutes
                 on each side until browned. Transfer the seared
                  beef to a plate and set aside.               
            </li>
            <li>In the same skillet, lower the heat to medium,
                 and add 2 tablespoons of butter. Add the 
                 chopped onions and sauté until softened,
                  about 4-5 minutes. Stir in the garlic 
                  and cook for another minute until fragrant.
            </li>
            <li>Add the sliced mushrooms and cook for about 5 minutes,
                 until they release their juices and become golden brown.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of flour over the mushroom-onion 
                mixture and stir to coat. Cook for about 1 minute.   
            </li>
            <li>Slowly pour in the beef broth while stirring continuously
                 to prevent lumps. Add Worcestershire sauce and 
                 Dijon mustard. Bring the mixture to a simmer and let it 
                 cook for 5 minutes, allowing the sauce to thicken slightly.
            </li>
            <li>Remove the skillet from the heat and stir in the sour cream
                 until well combined. <i>If the sauce is too thick, you can add a
                  little more beef broth to reach your desired consistency.</i>
            </li>
            <li>Return the seared beef (and any accumulated juices)
                 to the skillet, stirring to coat the beef in the sauce.
                  Simmer on low heat for 2-3 minutes, just until the beef 
                  is heated through. Be careful not to overcook the beef,
                   or it may become tough.
            </li>
            <li>
                Serve the beef stroganoff over egg noodles or rice.
                 Garnish with freshly chopped parsley,<i> if desired.</i>
            </li>
        </ol>
