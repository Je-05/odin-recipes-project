        <h2>Cooking Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Thinly</strong> slice the beef into strips, about ¼-inch thick.
                 Season with salt and pepper.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Heat</strong> 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet over 
                medium-high heat. Add the beef in batches to avoid 
                overcrowding the pan, and cook for about 2 minutes
                 on each side until browned. Transfer the seared
                  beef to a plate and set aside.               
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>In</strong> the same skillet, lower the heat to medium,
                 and add 2 tablespoons of butter. Add the 
                 chopped onions and sauté until softened,
                  about 4-5 minutes. Stir in the garlic 
                  and cook for another minute until fragrant.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Add</strong> the sliced mushrooms and cook for about 5 minutes,
                 until they release their juices and become golden brown.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Sprinkle</strong> 1 tablespoon of flour over the mushroom-onion 
                mixture and stir to coat. Cook for about 1 minute.   
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Slowly</strong> pour in the beef broth while stirring continuously
                 to prevent lumps. Add Worcestershire sauce and 
                 Dijon mustard. Bring the mixture to a simmer and let it 
                 cook for 5 minutes, allowing the sauce to thicken slightly.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Remove</strong> the skillet from the heat and stir in the sour cream
                 until well combined. <i>(If the sauce is too thick, you can add a
                  little more beef broth to reach your desired consistency.)</i>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Return</strong> the seared beef <i>(and any accumulated juices)</i>
                 to the skillet, stirring to coat the beef in the sauce.
            </li>
             <li>
                  <strong>Simmer</strong> on low heat for 2-3 minutes, just until the beef 
                  is heated through. Be careful not to overcook the beef,
                   or it may become tough.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Serve</strong> the beef stroganoff over egg noodles or rice.
                 <strong>Garnish</strong> with freshly chopped parsley,<i> if desired.</i>
            </li>
        </ol>
